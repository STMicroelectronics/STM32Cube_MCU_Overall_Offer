# STM32Cube MCU Overall Offer

## Overview

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio (MCU and MPU). It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform, delivered for each STM32 series.

* The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in this STM32 product.
* The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
* The BSP drivers of each evaluation, demonstration, or nucleo board provided for this STM32 series.
* A consistent set of middleware libraries such as RTOS, USB, FatFS, graphics, touch sensing library...
* A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) for each board provided for this STM32 series.

GitHub is a new publication model for the STM32Cube MCU embedded software. Different models of publication are proposed:

* The **MCU Package**: A unique repo per STM32 MCU series containing the different components of a STM32 MCU firmware (Drivers, Middleware, Utilities, Examples). Please refer to the [STM32Cube MCU Packages](README.md#stm32cube-mcu-packages) chapter below.
* The **MCU components**: Each component of a STM32 MCU firmware (Drivers, Middleware, Utilities) is proposed in a dedicated repo, allowing the user to select and get only the required ones. Please refer to the [STM32Cube MCU Components](README.md#stm32cube-mcu-components) chapter below.
* The **X-CUBE**: Expansion software proposing examples and applications that complement the ones of the STM32Cube firmware.
* A set of **MCU Utilities**: Various utility features proposed in dedicated repos.

Please note that a MPU offer is also proposed for the **STM32 MPU Products**. You can refer to the repo [STM32MPU_EmbSW_Overall_Offer](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32MPU_EmbSW_Overall_Offer).

## Description

This repo is a simple Readme describing all STM32 MCU related GitHub projects, the overall offer for the STM32 MCU products.

This new publication channel of the STM32Cube embedded software components will provide new added values:

* In complement to the MCU Package zip files today proposed on **st.com**, the capability for STM32 customers to get a configuration management based delivery (Git)
* A more direct communication between developers, thanks to the Issues features. **Caution**: only software related questions will be taken into account. Any other subject must be submitted to the [ST Community](https://community.st.com/stm32mcu) forum
* Thanks to the deployment of a Contributor License Agreement feature (please refer to each repo CONTRIBUTING guide), the **Pull-Request** permits also to take into account customers proposed updates and enrich the STM32Cube FW offer.

For general communication and support, you can use

* [ST Support Center](https://my.st.com/ols#/ols/) for any defect
* [ST Community Forum](https://community.st.com/stm32mcu) forum

### STM32Cube HAL Drivers

The **HAL Drivers** MCU Components propose the HAL and LL Drivers modules controlling all the HW IPs embedded in the STM32 products.

* HAL Drivers:
  * A set of portable abstraction APIs offering high level services, built around standalone processes. The HAL drivers are functionalities oriented, example: for the Timer peripheral, the APIs could be split into several categories following the functions offered by the IPs (Basic timer, capture, PWM...) for a communication IP: an initialisation function, eventually a configuration function and data transfer services (polling, interruption or DMA based)
  * The compatibility SHALL be guaranteed across all the STM32 families for the generic APIs, including generic macros and common structures defines. Any specific feature is given in a dedicated extension model available in the associated extension files

* LL Drivers:
  * Low Layer Drivers: a set of basic functions with direct hardware access (no standalone process), this layer can be called either by applications or by the HAL drivers.

HAL and LL Drivers are provided in the same module/repo

The dynamic usage of HAL APIs is provided thru projects examples, available in the respective STM32Cube MCU Packages **STM32Cubexx** where xx correspond to the series

### STM32Cube BSP Drivers

The **BSP Drivers** MCU Components propose the BSP Drivers modules, which are constituted from the:

* [STM32Cube BSP Boards Drivers](README.md#stm32cube-bsp-boards-drivers), **based on the HAL drivers**, and providing a set of high level APIs allowing a quick access to the boards services (**e.g.**, audio, graphics, access to external memories).
* [STM32Cube BSP Components Drivers](README.md#stm32cube-bsp-components-drivers) providing a set of high level APIs allowing a quick access to the (**e.g.**, audio codecs, LCD drivers, SD cards, MEMS). The **link** between these external components and the HAL drivers (**e.g.**, a SD card and the `OSPI`/`QSPI` HAL driver) is done within the **BSP Boards** drivers.

------

**NOTE:** A number of BSP **components** drivers (particularly of MEMS) come in **two forms**, each addressing a different purpose. For each one of such BSP components drivers, **two repositories** are available as explained below:

* **PID:** Platform-Independent Drivers. Recognizable to their repositories' names *\<bspcomp\>* (**e.g.**, [hts221](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/hts221)). Are **low-level** drivers allowing direct access to components' registers. These drivers are independent of any software platform, as the acronym PID suggests. The complete list can be found [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Standard_C_drivers).

* **STM32:** STM32Cube-compatible drivers. Recognizable to their repositories' names *stm32-\<bspcomp\>* (**e.g.**, [stm32-hts221](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32-hts221)). Are **hardware-abstracted** drivers, specially designed to be compatible with the STM32Cube software offer, as the `stm32-` prefix suggests. The complete list is provided [below](README.md#stm32cube-bsp-components-drivers) (refer particularly to tables `MEMS` and `Temperature Sensor`).
